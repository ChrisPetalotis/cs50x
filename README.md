# cs50x

Projects that I have completed throughout cs50x courses provided by Harvardx on edx.org

The 'Introduction to Computer Science' folder contains projects completed during the 'CS50's Introduction to Computer Science' course.

The 'Web development' folder contains projects completed during the 'CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript' course.

Only minor styling has been applied. Funcionality should be solid though.
